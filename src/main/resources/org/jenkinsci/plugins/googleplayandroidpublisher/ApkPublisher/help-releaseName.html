<div>
  The release name, used to identify this release in the Google Play Console UI.
  Not required to be unique among releases. If no value is entered, Google Play
  will set the release name to the versionName of the app file being uploaded.
  <p/>
  Any instances of <tt>{versionCode}</tt> or <tt>{versionName}</tt> in the value
  will be replaced by the respective value from the app file being uploaded. If
  multiple files are uploaded, the one with the lowest versionCode will be used.
  <p/>
  For example, entering <tt>Version {versionName}-${GIT_COMMIT}</tt> as release name could
  yield a release name on Google Play something like <tt>Version 1.2.3-b2c3d3e4</tt>.
  <hr/>
  This field supports substituting environment variables in the form
  <tt>${SOME_VARIABLE}</tt> or <tt>$SOME_VARIABLE</tt> at build time.
