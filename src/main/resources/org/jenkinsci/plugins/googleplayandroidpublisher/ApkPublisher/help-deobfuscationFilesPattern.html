<div>
  Specifies filenames or patterns matching one or more ProGuard mapping
  files that should be uploaded to Google Play, so that it can automatically
  deobfuscate stacktraces from crash reports.
  <p/>
  Note that if you build an Android App Bundle (AAB file) with ProGuard enabled,
  the mapping file should already be embedded in the app bundle (typically as
  <tt>BUNDLE-METADATA/com.android.tools.build.obfuscation/proguard.map</tt>.<br/>
  In such cases, you shouldn't use this option since Google Play will reject any
  attempt to upload a mapping file when the app bundle has one embedded.
  <p/>
  You can use wildcards like "<tt>**/build/**/mapping.txt</tt>".<br/>
  See <a href='https://ant.apache.org/manual/Types/fileset.html'>
  the 'includes' attribute of Ant's FileSet</a> for the exact format.<br/>
  Note that multiple entries must be comma-separated.
  <p/>
  The base directory is <a href='ws/'>the build's workspace</a>.
  You can only upload mapping files that are located in your workspace.
  <p/>
  If there are multiple AAB/APK files being uploaded, and only one mapping file
  is found in the workspace, then that mapping file will be associated with
  each of the app files being uploaded. If there are multiple mapping files
  found, a basic attempt will be made to automatically associate each mapping
  file with its corresponding app file.<br/>
  Otherwise, if the number of mapping files found is <em>not</em> equal to the
  number of app files being uploaded, the build will fail, as this situation is
  not supported.
  <p/>

  This field supports substituting environment variables in the form
  <tt>${SOME_VARIABLE}</tt> or <tt>$SOME_VARIABLE</tt> at build time.
