<div>
  Specifies the version codes of app files from a previous release which should be included in the release to be created
  by this build step.
  <p/>
  For example, if you have a Wear OS app file already released, but in this build step you only need to upload new
  mobile app files, you can enter the version code of the Wear OS app file to retain it for this new release, rather
  than having to upload it again here.
  <p/>
  Similarly, if you're using Multiple APK Support, you may have a situation where you only need to release an update to
  a single APK, and so you can use this functionality to retain the other APKs for this new release by entering their
  version codes.
  <p/>
  If you don't need this functionality, you can leave this field blank.
  Note that multiple entries must be comma-separated.
  <hr/>
  This field supports substituting environment variables in the form
  <tt>${SOME_VARIABLE}</tt> or <tt>$SOME_VARIABLE</tt> at build time.
