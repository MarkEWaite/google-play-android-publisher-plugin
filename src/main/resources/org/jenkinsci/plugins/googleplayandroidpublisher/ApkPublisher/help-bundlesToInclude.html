    You can optionally include/retain bundles from previous releases.
    This can be useful if your app has a Wearable variant in the same store listing.
    <p/>
    You specify version codes of the 'bundlesToInclude' as a comma separated String.
    E.g. '1,2' or '1' when you need only a single bundle to be retained.
    <p/>
    For more information on Including/Retaining bundles, see the Google Play
    documentation:<br/>
