<div>
  Specifies filenames or patterns matching one or more zip files containing
  native library symbols that should be uploaded to Google Play, so that it
  can automatically deobfuscate native crash dumps.
  <p/>
  Note that if you build an Android App Bundle (AAB file) with native libraries,
  using Android Gradle Plugin version 4.1 or newer, you can choose to
  <a href='https://developer.android.com/studio/build/shrink-code#native-crash-support'>
  automatically embed</a> the native symbols into the app bundle file.<br/>
  Therefore you don't need to use this option to upload the symbols separately.
  But if you do, the contents of this symbols file will supersede those embedded
  in the bundle.
  <p/>
  You can use wildcards like "<tt>**/build/**/native-debug-symbols.zip</tt>".<br/>
  See <a href='https://ant.apache.org/manual/Types/fileset.html'>
  the 'includes' attribute of Ant's FileSet</a> for the exact format.<br/>
  Note that multiple entries must be comma-separated.
  <p/>
  The base directory is <a href='ws/'>the build's workspace</a>.
  You can only upload symbols files that are located in your workspace.
  <p/>
  If there are multiple AAB/APK files being uploaded, and only one symbols file
  is found in the workspace, then that symbols file will be associated with
  each of the app files being uploaded. If there are multiple symbols files
  found, a basic attempt will be made to automatically associate each symbols
  file with its corresponding app file.<br/>
  Otherwise, if the number of symbols files found is <em>not</em> equal to the
  number of app files being uploaded, the build will fail, as this situation is
  not supported.
  <p/>

  This field supports substituting environment variables in the form
  <tt>${SOME_VARIABLE}</tt> or <tt>$SOME_VARIABLE</tt> at build time.
