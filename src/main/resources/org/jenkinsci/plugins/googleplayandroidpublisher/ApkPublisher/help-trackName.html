<div>
  Specifies the release track to which the given app file(s) will be assigned, or uploaded.
  <h2>Regular release tracks</h2>
  You can enter the name of a
  <a href='https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/3131213#create_additional_track'>custom
  track</a>, or one of the built-in tracks:
  <ul>
    <li><tt>internal</tt></li>
    <li><tt>alpha</tt></li>
    <li><tt>beta</tt></li>
    <li><tt>production</tt></li>
  </ul>
  For these tracks, you have the choice of rolling out the uploaded app files
  to all existing users immediately, or doing a staged rollout so that only
  a percentage of your existing userbase will be able to download the new version.
  Alternatively, you can set the rollout percentage to zero to create a draft release.
  <p/>
  For more information on using the internal, alpha, beta or custom testing tracks,
  see the Google Play documentation:<br/>

  </a>
  <h2>Internal App Sharing</h2>
  Alternatively, you can use the special track name <tt>internal-app-sharing</tt>, which will upload the app file —
  either an AAB or APK file — directly to <a href='https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9844679'>
  Internal App Sharing</a>.
  In this case, no other build step configuration is required, other than the Google Play credentials.
  <p/>
  Upon successful upload, the download URL for the uploaded file will be output to the build log.
  <hr/>
  This field supports substituting environment variables in the form
  <tt>${SOME_VARIABLE}</tt> or <tt>$SOME_VARIABLE</tt> at build time.
